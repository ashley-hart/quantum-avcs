# Modeling Quantum Communication Channels & Adversaries
**Ashley Hart and Dr. Anand Sarwate**

**RISE at Rutgers 2021 Summer Project**

This project explores the problem of achieving reliable quantum communication over arbitrarily varying channels (AVC). The quantum version of an AVC is referred to as an arbitrarily varying quantum channel (AVQC). A sender sends a message to a receiver over the AVC. Adversaries, or jammers, preside over the AVC and may influence the channel's states and the data that flows through it. We are conducting a literature review with the following in mind: 

**RESEARCH QUESTION:**
What abilities do adversaries for classical and quantum communication channels possess and how can we model them?

Work done for this project will be catalogued in this repository. This project aims to model the problem of quantum communication for entry level readers to spur additional work on arbitrarily varying quantum channels.
