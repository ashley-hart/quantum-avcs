# Modeling Quantum Communication Channels & Adversaries
**Ashley Hart and Dr. Anand Sarwate**

**RISE at Rutgers 2021 Summer Project**

This project explores the problem of achieving reliable quantum communication over arbitrarily varying channels (AVC). The quantum version of an AVC is referred to as an arbitrarily varying quantum channel (AVQC). A sender sends a message to a receiver over the AVC. Adversaries, or jammers, preside over the AVC and may influence the channel's states and the data that flows through it. We are conducting a literature review with the following in mind: 

**RESEARCH QUESTION:**
What abilities do adversaries possess on classical and quantum arbitrarily varying channels and how can we model them?

Please note, the literature review is ongoing. The final document will be added to this repository upon completion.
